# DICE-CIRCUIT
In this circuit, a dice would be made by combining the LEDâ€™s.
LED's are set up in H like circuit.Upper left and right leads are sepreate tfrom the bottom ones. When you press the button it connects the upper and botton leads together forming a circuit thus activating the dice.
We run a 3v3 connection to the button and have a 100k resistor to ground.In between the 100k resistor and the button we have the wire running to pin 2.This will detect whenever the button has been pressed. 
All the LED's are positioned to resemble a die face. Each LED is connected to a pin on the arduino ont the digital output.
